# SQL_Database-Design

## Description
For this assignment, I was tasked to build a database for a fictional local business. I was tasked to create tables, load them with sample data, and create a view and an index to to improve query performance. After creating the database and optimizing it to help the local business manage their data, I then created querys and complex table joins from the database to produce the needed reports.
